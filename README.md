# Smart Parking Project

## Overview
This is an IoT Smart Parking Project that aims to create a smart parking system using Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. The system is designed to make parking easier and more efficient by providing real-time information about parking space availability to users.

## Features
- Real-time parking space availability updates.
- Sensors to detect vehicle presence in parking spaces.
- LED displays for visual indications of available parking spots.

## Requirements
- Hardware components (IR sensors, LED displays, microcontroller).
- IoT development platform (Arduino).
- Power supply for Components.
- Knowledge of programming languages (Python, JavaScript, etc.).


## Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries and dependencies on your IoT devices.
3. Customize the code to fit your specific.
4. Deploy the IoT devices in the parking spaces.
5. Run the system and monitor its performance.


## Usage
- Users can access the parking availability information through LCD interface.
- IoT devices continuously collect data and update parking space availability in real-time.
